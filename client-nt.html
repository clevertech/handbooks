                <p><strong>Communication is ridiculously important.</strong></p>

                <p>The lack of communication is like the lack of oxygen. You die without it.</p>

                <p>We have daily standups, where for 5-10 minutes tops we talk about what was done the day before, what will be done in that day, and if there are any blockers that prevent us from moving forward.</p>

                <p>You can be a part of those daily standups, if you choose to.</p>

                <p>We also send you a weekly update where we mention the most important things we achieved that week and what’s planned for the next week.</p>

                <p>Additionally, we have one meeting at the end of each sprint (1 or 2 weeks) to talk with you about the progress made and the plan for the next sprint.</p>

                <p>You can be present in our HipChat room as well (no account required), which is where everyone in the team chats all day, every day.</p>

                <p>On Assembla (the project management software we use), you can also get a glimpse of what’s happening, priorities, and plan for the future.</p>

                <p>We are committed to help you launch the best product possible.</p>

                <p>That means we are transparent in all our communications.</p>

                <p>If there’s a problem, you’ll know.</p>

                <p>We are honest and expect nothing but honesty back. If there’s something bothering you, let us know.</p>

                <p>Projects work best when the information is transparent both ways.</p>

                <p><strong>We don’t know what you’ll get. Not right now.</strong></p>

                <p>We do know what the product should solve and do, though.</p>

                <p>And that’s where our focus will be.</p>

                <p>We will deliver the best product possible within the time period we defined.</p>

                <p>We will help you define the success/actionable metrics, for us to learn if the product is being successful or not.</p>

                <p>We will work with you to define the priorities for the first sprint, and deliver working features by the end of it, the most important ones.</p>

                <p>After that, we will work together again to re-evaluate the priorities for the next sprint, learn if anything should be changed from what was already done, and continue this iteration process.</p>

                <p>To make the product even better, we advise to put it in front of real end-customers as soon as possible, so we can achieve validated learning, which will enable us to make decisions based off of real data.</p>

                <p>This allows the product to shape into a successful product, instead of an “assumptions-based” product, based just off of scope.</p>

                <p>We’ll see you there.</p>
