                <p>Not only exist, but really have the possibility of living and helping others.</p>

                <p>Doing it is like making magic.</p>

                <p>We enable startups to test their product <strong>in the wild</strong>, as quickly as possible.</p>

                <p>We use <strong>Agile</strong> and <strong>Lean</strong> methodologies which at core are:</p>

                <ul class="square">
                    <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
                    <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
                    <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
                    <li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
                    <li>Not wasting time building something of no value</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We will build the first <strong><abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr></strong> and go through the build-measure-learn feedback loop as quickly as possible, to accomplish validated learning and decide what to build next (or what to change).</p>

                <p>We usually do that by defining goals for a sprint (1 or 2 weeks), and re-evaluating and defining new goals at the end of each sprint.</p>

                <p>We also help established enterprises (that act or want to act like startups) to build software that creates value and solves problems, using the same thinking and methods.</p>

                <p>We do it, because <strong>we’re passionate about creating</strong>.</p>

                <p>We are all about solving complex problems with simple solutions, and making software intuitive.</p>

            <h2>Communication</h2>

        <div class="container">
            <article class="twelve columns offset-by-two alpha omega">
                <p><strong>Communication is incredibly important.</strong></p>

                <p>The lack of communication is like the lack of oxygen. You die without it.</p>

                <p>We’re all communicating daily on Slack (most conversations happen in the project chat rooms, within each project’s team), and we try to video chat every day, for the daily standups.</p>

                <p>Daily Standups are basically 5-10 minute meetings that happen every day within each project’s team (usually 3-5 people), where everyone talks about what they did yesterday, what they’re going to do today, and if there are any blockers of progress they might need help with.</p>

                <p><strong>Ask for help.</strong></p>

                <p>One of the worst things you can do is say you’re on top of something, and actually not being on top of it, and that becoming evident the next day on the daily standup.</p>

                <p>It’s ok to say “I don’t know”. We’ll help you. We’re all here to learn too.</p>

                <p>As for personal problems, we all have them.</p>

                <p>If you feel something will get in the way of you being productive, just let us know.
                <br />Do not just disappear without saying anything to anyone. We’re all humans and understanding (except Slackbot).</p>

                <p><strong>Communication is not what you say, but what the other person understands.</strong></p>

                <p>It’s vital that you communicate in a clear and understandable way, adapted to who you’re talking to.</p>

            <h2>Structure</h2>

                <p>We’re all great people. Seriously. Reach out to anyone and find out!</p>

                <p>As we are at over 100, it’s no easy task to know everyone. But worry not, as everyone’s split into small teams of 3-5 people, per project.</p>

                <p>Each team is very independent and we usually think of them as an extension of the client. Everyone there will be dedicated to a project for 3-6 months (usually), and that should be their entire and unique focus.</p>

                <p>Each team will have a  <abbr title="Project Manager">PM</abbr>, who’s most times a Senior Developer as well. Anything you need, <strong>the <abbr title="Project Manager">PM</abbr> is the person to ask</strong>, including days off. That makes everyone more manageable inside the company.</p>

                <p>Because we have people spanning across all timezones in the world, and most our clients are in the U.S., we require everyone to <strong>work at least 5 hours within New York’s 9am-5pm</strong>. Ultimately, the hours are flexible according to your project and team’s needs.</p>

                <p>We also require you to have a decent internet connection and a backup (3G/4G), in case your main one fails. It should be enough to be able to work, do video calls, and screen sharing without any frustration. If you don’t have one, we can pay for that.<br>Your voice should also be echo-free and overall crystal clear. If you don’t have a good headset, we can pay for that.</p>

                <p>We also have <strong>CleverFridays</strong>, where everyone gets together. It's a great chance to share a side project you've launched or a presentation you delivered at a conference. We enjoy talks by guest speakers and much more!</p>

            <article class="twelve columns offset-by-two alpha omega">
                <p>We’re into Agile and Lean, but in a flexible manner.</p>

                <p>That means there are slight variations according to each project and team, but we usually have the <strong>backlog</strong> with the user stories (e.g. “As a paying customer, I want to view a report for how many visits my content is getting”), <strong>daily standups</strong> (view Communication), and <strong>1 or 2-week sprints</strong>.</p>

                <p>We love the concept of <abbr title="Minimum Viable Products">MVPs</abbr>, and mostly, the idea of starting from the simplest and quickest viable solution, and iterating from there.</p>
                
                <p>You can <a href="https://q.clevertech.biz/articles/clevertech-agile-development-process">read more about our process here</a>.</p>

                <p>If there’s a new technology out there, we love to experiment with it, and understand its advantages, ultimately using it when it makes sense.</p>

                <p>Clients are who enable us to keep building new things, so we strive to keep them satisfied, by providing them the best possible products within a given time frame. That means we don’t build for scope (or rather, build for scope in a sprint), but on goals.</p>

                <p>The best way to accomplish a successful product is to start having validated learning as soon as possible, by having the products we’re building in front of real end-customers as soon as possible, ideally while we’re developing the first <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr>, to understand which hypotheses are right and which need to be rethought.</p>

                <p><strong>After the first <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr> is launched</strong>, there’s usually a small period of maintenance, where the client is obtaining real feedback from the world, and after that, the iteration process continues. Always building better software.</p>

                <p>The way we came up with to assign vacations is to take a common sense approach.</p>

                <p>You need it, you take it, assuming no one gets upset. Take whatever's reasonable. We trust your judgement.</p>

                <p>Make sure to coordinate with your team and see if your vacations will affect client deliverables, and plan for them. We advise giving 3-4 weeks notice for vacations more than 2 days in a row.</p>

                <p>Note <strong>there are no given holidays</strong>. If you want any "regular date" (Dec. 25th or Jan. 1st, for example), you need to log those days as time off.</p>

                <p><a href="http://q.clevertech.biz/articles/taking-time-off" target="_blank">Here you can find a bit more on how to log time off</a>, so we know you're not available.</p>

                <p><strong>We don’t believe in overtime</strong>. If you need to work more than 8h/day on average, something is wrong. It’s not sustainable. Plan properly and don’t go over the 8h/day.</p>
