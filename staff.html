                <p>We use technology to make businesses more profitable.</p>

                <p>Our core value is serving our most basic human desire — the desire to create.</p>

                <p>Working with technology is like making magic.</p>

                <p>And we love what we do.</p>

            <h2>What, How, and Why</h2>
        </header>

        <div class="container">
            <article class="twelve columns offset-by-two alpha omega">
                <p>We enable startups to test their product <strong>in the wild</strong>, as quickly as possible.</p>

                <p>We use <strong>Agile</strong> and <strong>Lean</strong> methodologies which at core are:</p>

                <ul class="square">
                    <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
                    <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
                    <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
                    <li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
                    <li>Not wasting time building something of no value</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We will build the first <strong><abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr></strong> and go through the build-measure-learn feedback loop as quickly as possible, to accomplish validated learning and decide what to build next (or what to change).</p>

                <p>We usually do that by defining goals for a sprint (1 or 2 weeks), and re-evaluating and defining new goals at the end of each sprint.</p>

                <p>We also help established enterprises to build software that creates value and solves problems, using the same thinking and methods.</p>

                <p>We do it, because <strong>we’re passionate about creating</strong>.</p>

                <p>We are all about solving complex problems with simple solutions, and making software intuitive.</p>

            <h2>Communication</h2>
        </header>

        <div class="container">
            <article class="twelve columns offset-by-two alpha omega">
                <p><strong>Communication is incredibly important.</strong></p>

                <p>The lack of communication is like the lack of oxygen. You die without it.</p>

                <p>We’re all communicating daily on HipChat (most conversations happen in the project chat rooms, within each project’s team), and we try to video chat every day, for the daily standups.</p>

                <p>Daily Standups are basically 5-10 minute meetings that happen every day within each project’s team (usually 3-5 people), where everyone talks about what they did yesterday, what they’re going to do today, and if there are any blockers of progress they might need help with.</p>

                <p>Improving your English also would be helpful in communication. Take some time per week and improve your verbal and written skills.</p>

                <p><strong>Ask for help.</strong></p>

                <p>One of the worst things you can do is say you’re on top of something, and actually not being on top of it, and that becoming evident the next day on the daily standup.</p>

                <p>It’s ok to say “I don’t know”. We’ll help you. We’re all here to learn too.</p>

                <p>As for personal problems, we all have them.</p>

                <p>If you feel something will get in the way of you being productive, just let us know.
                <br />Do not just disappear without saying anything to anyone. We’re all humans and understanding (except Jarvis).</p>

                <p><strong>Communication is not what you say, but what the other person understands.</strong></p>

                <p>It’s vital that you communicate in a clear and understandable way, adapted to who you’re talking to.</p>

                <p>We’re all great people. Seriously. Reach out to anyone and find out!</p>

                <p>As we are at over 50, it’s no easy task to know everyone. But worry not, as everyone’s split into small teams of 3-5 people, per project.</p>

                <p>Each team is very independent and we usually think of them as an extension of the client. Everyone there will be dedicated to a project for 3-6 months (usually), and that should be their entire focus.</p>

                <p>Each team will have a  <abbr title="Project Manager">PM</abbr>, who’s most times a Senior Developer as well. Anything you need, <b>the <abbr title="Project Manager">PM</abbr> is the person to ask</b>, including days off. That makes everyone more manageable inside the company.</p>

                <p>Because we have people spanning across all timezones in the world, and most our clients are in the U.S., we require everyone to <b>work at least 5 hours within New York’s 9am-5pm</b>. Ultimately, the hours are flexible according to your project and team’s needs.</p>

                <p>We also require you to have a decent internet connection and a backup (3G/4G), in case your main one fails. It should be enough to be able to work, do video calls, and screen sharing without any frustration. If you don’t have one, we can pay for that.<br>Your voice should also be echo-free and overall crystal clear. If you don’t have a good headset, we can pay for that.</p>

                <p>We also have <b>CleverFridays</b> every third Friday of the month, where everyone gets together for a couple of hours to talk about the company and meet everyone else.</p>

            <h2>Things we care about</h2>

        <div class="container">
            <article class="twelve columns offset-by-two alpha omega">
                <p>We’re into Agile and Lean, but in a flexible manner.</p>

                <p>That means there are slight variations according to each project and team, but we usually have the <strong>backlog</strong> with the user stories (e.g. “As a paying customer, I want to view a report for how many visits my content is getting”), <strong>daily standups</strong> (view Communication), and <strong>1 or 2-week sprints</strong>.</p>

                <p>We love the concept of <abbr title="Minimum Viable Products">MVPs</abbr>, and mostly, the idea of starting from the simplest and quickest viable solution, and iterating from there.</p>

                <p>If there’s a new technology out there, we love to experiment with it, and understand its advantages, ultimately using it when it makes sense.</p>

                <p>Clients are who enable us to keep building new things, so we strive to keep them happy, by providing them the best possible products within a given time frame. That means we don’t build for scope (or rather, build for scope in a sprint), but on goals.</p>

                <p>The best way to accomplish a successful product is to start having validated learning as soon as possible, by having the products we’re building in front of real end-customers as soon as possible, ideally while we’re developing the first <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr>, to understand which hypotheses are right and which need to be rethought.</p>

                <p><strong>After the first <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr> is launched</strong>, there’s usually a small period of maintenance, where the client is obtaining real feedback from the world, and after that, the iteration process continues. Always building better software.</p>

            <h2>Time off</h2>
        </header>

        <div class="container">
            <article class="twelve columns offset-by-two alpha omega">
                <p>The way we came up with to assign vacations is to take a common sense approach. A work day is 8 hours. There are five workdays in a week. And each month ranges 20-23 working days. So, standard month is 160-184 standard hours.</p>

                <p>We promise our clients that we will deliver at least 160 hours per month. And so we require everyone to deliver 160 hours per month. Hours worked over that will give you up to 16 hours per month of Paid Time Off (PTO). If you work in excess of 176h (standard monthly days (22) x 8hr/day) those are reviewed as exceptional circumstances and are reviewed as such. We have to be careful not to create a motivation to slow down and work more hours, if all we do is measure hours.</p>

                <p>If you look through the entire year, it comes to a total of approx 21 PTO days, which is a full month off. At the same time we want to reward people who go above and beyond the standard expectation.<br><b>There are no given holidays</b>. If you want any “regular date” (Dec. 25th or Jan. 1st, for example), you need to ask for those days off as PTO time. PTO expires at each year-end.</p>

                <p>For taking the time, we will coordinate with your team and see if your vacations will affect client deliverables, and plan for them. We advise giving 1-2 months notice for vacations more than 2 days in a row.</p>

                <p><b>We don’t believe in overtime</b>. If you need to work more than 8h/day on average, something is wrong. It’s not sustainable. Plan properly and don’t go over the 8h/day.</p>

                <p>Some people like offices or shared spaces, others prefer home offices or a coffee shop.</p>

                <p>As long as you can provide the value we need you to, we don’t really care where you’re working from.</p>
